**Update: on 16-NOV-2011 version 1.2 was released**


Responsepredictor (RP) is an easy to use tool for boolean modeling of biological processes by molecular biologists. It is a so called Integrated Development Environment which supports an iterative process of building, simulating and checking of a boolean model. The current focus is on signalling pathways.

Because RP is webbased, no client installation is required and upgrades are immediately available for all users. RP is free, open source software. It is written in Java and uses Cytoscape Web for the network visualization, which is a flash component with a Javascript API.

We thank Jan Krumsiek of the Institute of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology in Neuherberg (Germany) for creating for this project a Java version of his boolean simulation engine Odefy (1).
