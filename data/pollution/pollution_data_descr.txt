    * Description:

      Ligninsulfonate, a compound released into water from sulfite pulp mills, contributes to the general pollution of 
      seawaters and may be fatal to fish resources. This compound has been determined with some success by using 
      fluorescence spectrometry. With this method, possible interferences arise from humic acid and detergents 
      containing optical whiteners. The emission spectra of these compounds are severely overlapping and no 
      spectral region with a single emitting compound can be found. Samples of multicomponent calibration 
      solutions were prepared and subjected to fluorescence spectrometry. The data are from Lindberg et al. (1983), 
      where they were also analyzed with several multivariate calibration techniques.

    * Analysis

      Lindberg et al. (1983) used these data to illustrate the advantages of PLS in case severe interferences are present.
