Release changes:

1.2.1
* Nodes in observations (again) identified by label in stead of id. Reasons for these are:
1. no need to keep node ids in sync in case working on multiple networks
2. In Cytoscape ids can be changed following delete of nodes.


1.2
* Feature to run simulation for an observation using it's start and fixed values
* Feature to edit observations
* Panel for observations can be hidden.
* Observations can now be values between 0 and 1 

1.0b7
* There is no longer a limitation to 32 nodes. Software is tested
.. for 150 nodes.

1.0b6
* Added function to calculate score for modelchecking result.
* Obs details now in the same table as the Master
* Modelcheck score now calculated as ratio.
* Added score to modelcheck result in webinterface
* Solved issue not able to create new node or edge
* Added notes field to node
* Feature to edit existing node

1.0beta5
Solved issue:
ID DESCRIPTION
22 Details observations no longer drawn 


1.0beta4
Solved issues:
ID DESCRIPTION
19	After clicking edge, names nodes not correct in menu
20	Json error for carriage return
21. Flash component not working in Firefox on mac 


1.0beta
* Uses now Java implementation of the Odefy simulation engine. Matlab runtime engine is therefore no longer needed.
* Added feature to add one or more observations and check the model against this observations

When importing xgmml in which none of the nodes have a state field, this field is now added. It gets the default value
null as NaN as not accepted. Apparently Cytoscape web converts this null to 0.
 Before Cytoscape web already added the field in case of at least one node having the field. 

-----------
0.6.3
ID  DESCRIPTION
18   Option to change default start value 
In case of created new MWArray objects, you have to free the memory afterward


-----------
0.6.2
ID  DESCRIPTION
15  Attempted to access LimsN(0) 

-----------
0.6.1
Bugfixes:
ID  DESCRIPTION
12. In case all nodes are removed, new node gets as id inifinity. Changed this to 0.
13. When closing window, give warning in case of unsaved changes.


----------
0.6.0
Implemented calculation of steady state.

-----------
0.5.0
Implemented checkbox for fixed values to mimic knockdown and/or constitutive active
start values are now entered with select box with values 0 and 1, in stead of free text field

---------------
0.4.0
Implemented "and" gates
bugfix in the CNOimportSIF when using InputAsStrings=true and providing Type file. 
The parsing in that case was based on '\t' in stead of a ' ' (space). 
----------------
0.3.3
Constraint only one edge between two nodes
Constraint only one node with a specific label, disregard any different use in casing.
----------------
0.3.2
Added features to remove a node or edge.
-----------------
0.3.1
Upgraded the integrated Cytoscape Web to version 0.7.2, which  fixes a defect where node positions were incorrect in exported XGMML.
----------------
0.3.0 
With the 0.3.0 release, the project is limited to support pathway building and simulation. Features for building a phenotype model are temporarily removed from the application. 
---------------
Using now Cytoscape web, user can upload and edit networks and simulate them instantly using the integrated simulation engine of CellNetAnalyzer/Odefy.
